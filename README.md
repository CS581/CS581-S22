## Assignments
Assingments will be a mix of written and programming assignments. Written assignments will require you to solve toy versions of the problems manually. Programming assignments will require you to write Python code to solve larger problems. 

Possible programming assignments include 
* Write a program that uses reinforcement learning to play a game
* Write a program that uses Long-short Term Memory network to classify a document

## Programming Language

Python 3.x
